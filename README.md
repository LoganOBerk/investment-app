# Program Documentation Guidelines

Fields marked **"if N/A – None"** must still appear with the literal value `None` so readers know the field was considered.

---

## Classes
```python
# PURPOSE:
#    - <ClassName> provides <X> abstraction
#    - <why the abstraction exists>
```

---

## Functions
```python
# INPUT: if N/A - None
#    - <param_name>(type); <what it represents>
# OUTPUT: if N/A - None
#    - <var_name>(type); <what it represents>
# PRECONDITION: if N/A - None
#    - <param_name or state>; <value constraint>
# POSTCONDITION: if N/A - None
#    - <param or state>; <observable guarantee after return>
# RAISES: if N/A - None
#    - <ExceptionType>; <condition that triggers it>
def function_name(param_name: type) -> type:
    return var_name
```

## Style Rules

| Rule | Description |
|---|---|
| **Semicolons** | Separate name/type from description with `"; "` |
| **Indentation** | Labels flush-left; entries indented with TAB |
| **Types** | Use Python builtins or `typing` module. Project-defined types listed in [Types](#types) below. Persistent types carry `id` (database primary key). Nested collections may be abbreviated in higher layers when element types are defined in a referenced `POSTCONDITION`. |
| **Constraints** | State value constraints, not types — `n > 0` not `"must be int"` |
| **Guarantees** | Describe observable state, not implementation details |
| **Be brief** | Short phrase per entry, not full sentences |
